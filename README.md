# Project Title
Best Boba 

## Overview

Best Boba is a web application designed to help users discover the best-ranked bubble tea shops in Vancouver. Users can search for shops, view ratings, and find detailed information about each shop and its menu offerings.

### Problem

With the growing popularity of bubble tea, enthusiasts often struggle to find the highest quality shops. General review sites don't always cater specifically to one specific bubble tea, and it can be hard to distinguish between shops based on generic ratings. BubbleTea Finder addresses this issue by focusing solely on bubble tea.

### User Profile

Bubble Tea Enthusiasts: Individuals who are passionate about bubble tea and want to find the best options.
Casual Consumers: People who enjoy bubble tea occasionally and want recommendations for the best places.
